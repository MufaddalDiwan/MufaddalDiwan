## Hi there 👋

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building out my **GitHub portfolio** with beginner-friendly tools and real-world problem solvers
- Improving my **coding skills** and learning Git for version control

## 🎯 Goals
- Break into tech through practical experience, not just theory
- Combine my CS degree with real-world problem solving
